# Simple GAN for MNIST

In this notebook I created a simple neural network to test out GAN architecture. The popular MNIST hand written dataset is used to train a Generator and Discriminator network. The generator takes in a 1 dimensional vector of length 100 and uses this latent information to generate a random digit.

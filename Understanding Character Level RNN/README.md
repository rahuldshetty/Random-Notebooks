This notebook is based on the code from the following article: [Medium](https://blog.usejournal.com/how-to-develop-a-character-based-neural-language-model-99c18de1d4d2). The neural network takes in a sequence of characters and predicts the next character.

The Shakespear's literature is taken as a dataset to train the model.

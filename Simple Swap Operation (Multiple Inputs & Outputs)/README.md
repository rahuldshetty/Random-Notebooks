# Swap Operation with Neural Network

I created this notebook to test out multiple input and output architecture for a tensorflow-keras model. I have taken up a simple problem of swapping two inputs and created a neural network for this. The first network takes in two seperate Inputs and output is a single layer of 2 neruons. The second model contains two seperate inputs and two seperate outputs. 

For the dataset, I randomly generated some samples of two dimensional data. Each of these models are trained with the same dataset. Both the models were able to generalize the swap operation very well.
